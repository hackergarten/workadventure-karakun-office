This map is live over [here](https://play.workadventu.re/_/global/www.hackergarten.net/workadventure-karakun-office/map.json) and is under heavy construction => **EAP**.

There are total 8 `jitsiRoom`s in this map where more than 4 persons at a time can have a conversation. 

5 rooms correspond to a real meeting rooms in the office, the others are for recreational use only. 😁
