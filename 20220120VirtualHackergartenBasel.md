2022.01.20 Virtual Hackergarten Basel

Hello and welcome to Virtual Hackergarten Basel January 2022!

## Introduction

This is a Workadventure representation of the Karakun office, where we meet often times if it not pandemic.
If you get close by an other participant, an instant jisti chat opens.
If you get to a room, a dedicated jitsi session starts.

Please find us in our Slack channel (see hackergarten.net for details how to join) in case WA does not work as expected and you want to chat :)

## Topics

(we will collect topics to work on at the start of the hackergarten. 

Please make your way to the upper right corner of the map where the HG logo is. There we will meet&greet and discuss the start.)
